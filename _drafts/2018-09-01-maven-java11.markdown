When moving to Java 11 it isn't just your own code that needs to be updated to work with Java 11's modular system:
Using the **maven-jdeps-plugin** you can check which of your maven dependencies _and_ which parts of your own code use which modules of the JRE:  
```
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-jdeps-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>3.1.1</version>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <goals>
                <goal>jdkinternals</goal> <!-- verify main classes -->
                <goal>test-jdkinternals</goal> <!-- verify test classes -->
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
    <configuration>
        <!--<dotOutput>target/</dotOutput>-->
        <multiRelease>9</multiRelease>
        <failOnWarning>true</failOnWarning>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
```   

Sometimes you will also need to update maven dependencies to work with Java 11 as well.  
I encountered the not very informative `Unsupported class file major version 55` error indicating that Java 11 was unsupported by the **maven-dependency-plugin**.  
Except the version I was using was supposedly supported.  
After some digging around I discovered this open issue [MDEP-613](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MDEP-613) in the maven shared library bug tracker.  
I indicated that the **maven-dependency-analyzer** used by the dependency plugin didn't support Java 11 with the solution being to add a specific version (1.11.1) of the maven-dependency-analyzer within the maven-dependency-plugin declaration like below:  
```
<plugin>
	<groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
	<artifactId>maven-dependency-plugin</artifactId>
	<version>3.1.0</version>
	<executions>
	    <execution>
	        <id>analyze</id>
	        <goals>
	            <goal>analyze-only</goal>
	        </goals>
	        <configuration>
	            <failOnWarning>false</failOnWarning>
	            <ignoreNonCompile>true</ignoreNonCompile>
	        </configuration>
		</execution>
	</executions>
	<dependencies>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.apache.maven.shared</groupId>
			<artifactId>maven-dependency-analyzer</artifactId>
			<version>1.11.1</version>
		</dependency>
	</dependencies>
</plugin>
```
And now I have maven playing nicely with Java 11!
