Having been recently looking for a job again I've been exposed to the usual hyperbole and frankly bullshit terms both businesses and recruiters use on a regular basis.  
Here is a run down of my favourites and what I think they _really_ mean:  

## We're looking for someone who...
* **is a self starter** - we have no documentation
* **keeps up with latest technology** - we don't train our staff
* **is passionate about technology** - as long as it works we're happy, if you want an up to date stack then you'll have to drag us forward.
* **likes to code in their spare time** - you'll be overloaded and coding for us in your spare time
* **enjoys solving problems** - 50% of our last funding round was based on papering over the  problems we've yet to solve
* **can take ownership of their work** - the only business quality checks we have is the sanity of our developers
* **is an expert in a 6 month old technology** - we place great stock in the latest, unproven, most hyped framework/language/tooling on the block, technical ability is secondary to self promotion
* **is capable of communicating with our global development teams** - we outsourced and now regret it
* **will quickly integrate with the team** - we've been looking for someone for this role for six months and we're getting desperate.
* **can work with junior and non-technical teams to share knowledge and skills** - everyone here is working out of their depth and has little training but a "can do attitude"
* **Ideal candidates for this role learn and adapt quickly** - we have no onboarding process at all

## As a company we...
* **have a product used daily by x (large) number of customers** - we need help with our production environment, it's basically legacy and we're going to throw you straight in
* **have a fast paced environment** - we constantly fire fight problems
* **are an agile company** - we don't plan anything
* **have beers every Friday** - our all hands meetings are so boring we have to bribe you
* **are in a cutting edge industry** - no one has regulated our approach yet, the things we do could one day be classed as illegal
* **are an online gaming company** - we're a gambling company
* **are looking for a ninja/wizard/guru** - we think tech is basically black magic and we have no idea what we're doing.
* **work in a high transaction environment** - traders will throw things at you when services go down
* **we're international** - we're screwed post brexit or you're screwed as we'll relocate

## Ridiculous Stuff Managers and C-Level staff spout
* **Transition** - I want to uproot everything
* **Touch base** - I'll talk to you when no-one else is here to hold me accountable
* **As a business we need to consider** - we need to make a decision absent any sort of moral compass or individual responsibility.  
* **Take it offline** - it's awkward and we don't want anyone else to know our issues
* **At the end of the day the business needs to make money** - fuck your personal feelings about how things operate
* **We need to move fast** - someone handed the customer a date and then forgot about it
* **Some turnover is expected** - employees are leaving and we don't know why, we'd rather assume this is an industry problem
* **Moving forward** - I'm wrong/we made a mistake but don't want to admit it
* **Give 110%** - I don't know basic maths
* **Lean In** - Everyone should work harder for me
